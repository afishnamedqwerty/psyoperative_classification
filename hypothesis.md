Hypothesis Formulation
Start by formulating a hypothesis regarding the presence of bot-generated content in LLM training
data and its potential effects on bias within the models' output. For example, 'Bot-generated content
in social media and forums, when included in the training data of LLMs, introduces or amplifies
specific biases within the model's output.'

Outline types of bot-generated content relevant to LLM training data

evidence of social media scraping for LLM training

evidence of LLM (or any model) showing abnormal behavior following training on poisoned data - preferably proof of feature accuracy degradation
