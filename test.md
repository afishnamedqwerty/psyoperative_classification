    Embedding Techniques:
    Advanced machine learning models that utilize node and structural embeddings have become central in identifying bots within social networks. These methods involve creating representations of social media accounts that encapsulate their relational properties within the network, which can then be used to classify accounts as bots or not. This includes examining user metadata, tweet content, and the structure of their social network connections​ (SpringerOpen)​.

    Dataset Construction and Feature Utilization:
    The quality of data and the features used are crucial in training detection models. Datasets like TwiBot-20 incorporate a mix of semantic, property, and neighborhood information to represent accounts comprehensively. Features derived from these datasets include the number of followers, tweet frequency, and types of interactions, which are critical for accurate bot detection​ (SpringerOpen)​.

    Challenges with Bot Detection:
    Detection techniques face numerous challenges, including the adaptation of bots that mimic human behavioral patterns. Bots are becoming sophisticated enough to pass basic Turing tests, making them harder to detect based on content alone. Therefore, detection methods also focus on network behavior and metadata rather than just content analysis​ (First Monday)​.

    Utilization of AI and Machine Learning:
    Deep learning models, particularly those based on Transformer architectures, are at the forefront of distinguishing between bot-generated and human-generated content. These models analyze patterns of language use, engagement timing, and other subtleties that may indicate automated activity. The complexity of these models allows for an increasingly nuanced understanding of what constitutes bot-like activity on platforms like Twitter and Facebook​ (SpringerOpen)​​ (First Monday)​.

    Current Research and Development:
    Current research is not only focused on detection but also on understanding the intent behind bot activities—differentiating between benign bots (like chatbots for customer service) and malicious bots (used for misinformation). This involves a deeper analysis of the content's context, the account's network behavior, and changes in activity patterns over time​ (First Monday)​.



    Bot Detection Categories:
    - User profile metadata
    - Natural language features (NLP) from user tweets
    - Features extracted from the underlying social network

    Scalable and Generalizable Social Bot Detection through Data Selection
    - Popular approaches leverage user, temporal, content, and social network features with random forest classifiers

    - Using supervised learning framework with random forest classifiers, attempting to achieve both the scalability of the faster methods and the accuracy of the feature-rich methods.
    - Unsupervised learning methods are used to find improbably similarities among accounts. No human labeled datasets are needed

    - Faster classiciation can be obtained using fewer features and logistic regression
    - tweet content including metadata to detect bots at the tweet level
    - a simpler approach is to test the randomness of the screen name



    Okay first we need to decide the appropriate learning framework for your project.
    - Supervised learning
        - Most supervised learning methods require manually labeled data
        - Popular approaches leverage user, temporal, content, and social network features with random forest classifiers
